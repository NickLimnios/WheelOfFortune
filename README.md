# WheelOfFortune

In this .net core application, the user has the opportunity to bet an amount of his balance and play a game that "spins the wheel". Based on the outcome of the spin the final amount, is added to or substracted from his balance. The user also can add amount to his balance using coupons. Finnally, the user can see his all of his transactions (eg. spin results, balance upates).

The application, also has an administration dashboard, where a user with administrator rights can manage user roles, issue or revoke coupons and preview all user transactions.
